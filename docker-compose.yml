      # We need zookeeper to advertise two different urls since the broker has to be reachable

      # However it is neither possible to advertise two listeners but only configure one via KAFKA_LISTENERS
      # nor is it possible to advertise two listeners with the same protocol but different ports and hostnames since
      # they are still considered to have the same name.
      # We can do nothing about the former case but we can trick kafka with a custom protocol in the latter case.
